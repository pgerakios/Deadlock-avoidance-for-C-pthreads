TODO LIST
---------

1. 	Heap allocation in loop is not allowed.

2.  Stack arrays should include local variables.

3.  Consider arrays instead of hashtables for heap allocation. (?)

4.  Write how the data flow works !!

5.  Recursive effects - need to figure out what we're gonna do 

6.  Check out what happens when formal params don't match the real.

7.  Big offsets error

8.  Do we need to take values passed as pointers in pthread_create into
consideration, ex. to see if the new thread alters them.

9.  In recursive functions, check if the function we are about to inline has an
effect. If not, allow it.
